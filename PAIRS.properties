# Define the market we are trading (BTC, ETH, XMR or USDT)
# Please do not uncomment the following unless you know what you are doing.
# This is for future use when full settings will be provided for each market.
# For now BTC is the only market settings we provide.
#MARKET = ETH
#MARKET = XMR
#MARKET = USDT
MARKET = BTC

# Enable trading (buying,selling and orders) using defined strategies for all pairs 
# If trading_enabled = false your running pairs/pendings orders and balance will still be displayed in watchmode
ALL_trading_enabled = true

# We have changed the way we pick pairs as of v1.0.6 we let the bot do the work for us.
#
# We now manage by exception and black list the pairs we dont want to trade
# and only take the top volume pairs. We let the bot take its time to pick good pairs
# while our pairs log clears or we DCA until we clear the pairs.
# The day trader bot now uses Bolinger Bands strategies to buy low and sell high.
#
# Our goal is to be in and out of a trade quickly. We therefore want pairs that will clear quickly 
# The day trading method hinges on picking good pairs you think are going to be volatile.
#
# When picking pairs manually You want to look for a good argument 
# happening on the coin i.e. lots of ups and downs with a pattern like a saw blade.
# The longer that sawblade pattern (oscilation) goes sideways or upwards the better.
#
# If market goes bad try the following two strategies:
# a. Shotgun pairs - target any pair that has had a rise in the last 3 days
# b. Sniper pairs - sniper pairs use 3 passes:
# 1. First pass is to look for sawtooth pattern in normal manner by eyeballing the charts, this gets you a baseline set of pairs to work with;
# 2. Second pass is to examine baseline pairs and use the charts to target any pair that has had a rise in the last 3 days and has high volume only; and
# 3. Third pass is to use your exchange and target pairs with > 600 in volume only.
#
# Here is what the passes look like, note each pass has less and less pairs:
# 1st pass using charts and sawtooth pattern - ALL_enabled_pairs = BTC-ADT,BTC-ARK,BTC-BAY,BTC-BCC,BTC-BLK,BTC-CFI,BTC-CVC,BTC-DASH,BTC-DCR,BTC-DCT,BTC-DGB,BTC-DNT,BTC-EBST,BTC-EDG,BTC-ENG,BTC-ENRG,BTC-ETC,BTC-ETH,BTC-EXP,BTC-FCT,BTC-FUN,BTC-GNT,BTC-HMQ,BTC-IOP,BTC-KMD,BTC-LBC,BTC-LMC,BTC-LSK,BTC-MAID,BTC-NAV,BTC-NEO,BTC-NLG,BTC-NXT,BTC-OK,BTC-OMG,BTC-QTUM,BTC-RCN,BTC-SALT,BTC-SNT,BTC-STEEM,BTC-STORJ,BTC-SYS,BTC-UBQ,BTC-VIA,BTC-VRM,BTC-WAVES,BTC-XEM,BTC-XLM,BTC-XMR,BTC-XRP,BTC-XVG,BTC-XZC,BTC-ZEC,BTC-ZEN
# 2nd pass using charts and looking for rise in last 3 days volume - ALL_enabled_pairs = BTC-ADT,BTC-BCC,BTC-DGB,BTC-DNT,BTC-EDG,BTC-ETC,BTC-ETH,BTC-IOP,BTC-KMD,BTC-LSK,BTC-MAID,BTC-NEO,BTC-RCN,BTC-SALT,BTC-SYS,BTC-UBQ,BTC-XEM,BTC-XLM,BTC-XRP,BTC-XVG

# your own trading style. Dont forget to enable it in the DCA file also.
# See DCA file for other trigger settings.

# NOTE:  There is a known error in PT v1.2.5.5+
